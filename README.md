# content-only
A plain, un-styled version of the beta content used for a new draft of the CCB website. Files are in markdown just for basic text flavors.

Start by viewing the [Home Page](home.md)

Not all pages will have all the navigation expected to be present on a standard website, because this is just a place to quickly make simple web markup files and figure out what words and information we really need on the pages.
