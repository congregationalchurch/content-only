## Outreach - To Our Community & the World

Our Outreach Team works faithfully to follow Jesus’ commandment. Our congregation strives to give 10% of our pledged income each year to help others both locally and throughout the world. We also reach out to those in need by the giving of our time and talent.

The largest single recipient of our financial assistance is the United Church of Christ's “Our Churches Wider Mission” (OCWM). Watch the video at www.ucc.org/ocwm for more information.

We support many local area organizations with both financial donations and volunteer effort. These organizations include Association for Individual Development (AID), Habitat for Humanity, Hesed House, Lazurus House, Mutual Ground, the Midwest Shelter for Homeless Vets, CASA, Riverwood’s Christian Center, Tri-City Family Services, Batavia Food Pantry and more.

Some of our current projects are an Adult/Youth Mission project in Cairo, IL, collecting books for Aunt Mary's Storybook Project, and our Annual Christmas Gift Festival.

> "I was hungry and you gave me something to eat,
I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,
I was a stranger and you invited me in,
I needed clothes and you clothed me,
I was sick and you looked after me,
I was in prison and you came to visit me."

Matthew 25:35-37
