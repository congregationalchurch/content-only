## Outreach - To Our Community & the World

Our Outreach Team works faithfully to follow Jesus’ commandment. Our congregation strives to give 10% of our pledged income each year to help others both locally and throughout the world. We also reach out to those in need by the giving of our time and talent.

The largest single recipient of our financial assistance is the United Church of Christ's “Our Churches Wider Mission” (OCWM). Watch the video at www.ucc.org/ocwm for more information.

We support many local area organizations with both financial donations and volunteer effort. These organizations include Association for Individual Development (AID), Habitat for Humanity, Hesed House, Lazurus House, Mutual Ground, the Midwest Shelter for Homeless Vets, CASA, Riverwood’s Christian Center, Tri-City Family Services, Batavia Food Pantry and more.

Some of our current projects are an Adult/Youth Mission project in Cairo, IL, collecting books for Aunt Mary's Storybook Project, and our Annual Christmas Gift Festival.

> "I was hungry and you gave me something to eat,
I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,
I was a stranger and you invited me in,
I needed clothes and you clothed me,
I was sick and you looked after me,
I was in prison and you came to visit me."

Matthew 25:35-37

### [Fox Valley Habitat for Humanity ](http://foxvalleyhabitat.org/)

Fox Valley Habitat for Humanity is a Habitat for Humanity non-profit affiliate dedicated to the Fox Valley community. They work in partnership with God and people of all faiths and races to develop communities for people in need by building and renovating houses, creating homeownership opportunities based on the premise of providing a hand up; not a handout. As an affiliate, they are a grass roots organization that is independently operated to serve our local area community. While operating under the greater Habitat Covenant, they independently coordinate all aspects of Habitat home building in our area—fundrisinga; building site selection; partner family selection and support; house construction; and mortgage servicing. With the support of the community they have proudly served the Fox Valley communities for 20 years. They have successfully partnered with 47 families and have built 45 homes in Aurora and
Montgomery.

### [Fox Valley Christian Action](http://www.fvchristianaction.org/)

Formerly known as Riverwoods, the Family Campus is their headquarters facility and includes all of the programs and experiences that they offer "on campus." The mission of FVCA is to serve as a central venue and structured environment for training, education, and discipleship programs which require facilities away from the housing communities – a great place to get away and connect with God! Life skills outreach includes everything that they do in the communities all year-round. Staffed by eight full time Community Coordinators who partner with local church congregations, they place everyday people as teachers, mentors and volunteer advocates to serve in under-resourced communities.

### HAVE (Home Assistance Volunteer Effort)

HAVE was started by church member, Bob Hawse, over 25 years ago. The mission is to help people live safely in their homes. Projects may include: fixing a leaky faucet, mending a broken light switch, or installing grab bars or a ramp. All labor is volunteer and includes electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and carpentry. To volunteer or to get service, call our hotline at 630-375-7227. HAVE meets the second Thursday of each month in the church library at 7:30 pm. If you
have additional questions, give Dick MacFeely a call at 630-319-5905. Cash contributions are always welcomed at P.O. Box 971, Batavia, IL, 60510.

### [Elderday Center](http://elderdaycenter.org/)

Elderday Center offers socialization to reduce loneliness, depression, and isolation, exercise and recreation which can slow memory loss and maintain physical health. They provide group and individual activities, meals and snacks, and professional supervision for those with dementia, with long-term care insurance applied to cost of services. Clients meeting criteria may qualify
for financial assistance through the Community Care Program. Caregiver counseling is also available free of charge. Caregivers do not have to utilize Elderday's adult daycare services to qualify for this service.

### [Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Kane County](http://www.casakanecounty.org/index.html)

Court Appointed Special Advocate/Guardian ad Litem (CASA/GAL) volunteers are ordinary people doing extraordinary things to serve over 500 children in our abuse/neglect and probate courts each year. CASA volunteers are everyday citizens appointed by judges to advocate for the safety and well-being of children who have been removed from their homes due to parental abuse and neglect. They stand up for our children and make a difference one child at a time.
