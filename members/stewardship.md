## Stewardship

Stewardship is not just for the Fall anymore, and it's never been just about money. Whether it's care for God's creation, attention to our families and relationships, making the most of talents and skills, or being responsible and generous with our finances....it's all stewardship. And it's all the time.

### 2015 Campaign - Trust in the promise

> "For surely I know the plans I have for you... to give you a future with hope."

-Jeremiah 29:11

More details on this years pledging campaign will be published here.

### Online Pledging
To plan responsibly for the coming year, we need to have an understanding of what funds we will have to work with. The stewardship campaign collects financial pledges from our members and friends. These pledges are then used as the basis for creating our operating budget for the following year.

The operating budget allocates funds to support our staff salaries, our facilities, our ministries and our programs. This is different from a capital budget, which focuses on obtaining or improving buildings or assets. The operating fund is different from a special offering to support a mission or special project. The operating budget, resulting from the stewardship campaign, supports our churchâ€™s basic needs.
